    "## Short description of the SPEEDY model\n",
    "\n",
    "SPEEDY is an atmospheric global circulation model that uses the spectral dynamical core developed\n",
    "at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\n",
    "Its main characteristics are:\n",
    "- A spectral-transform model in the vorticity-divergence form with a semi-implicit treatment of gravity waves.\n",
    "- Hydrostatic σ-coordinate in the vertical coordinate.\n",
    "- The principal model prognostic variables are vorticity, divergence, temperature, and the logarithm of surface pressure.\n",
    "- Humidity is advected by the dynamical core, and with its sources and sinks are determined physical parametrizations.\n",
    "- The horizontal resolution corresponds to a triangular spectral truncation at total wavenumber 30 (T30, approximately 3.75 x 3.75 degree resolution). This corresponds to a [Gaussian grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_grid) of 96 (longitude) by 48 (latitude) points. \n",
    "- For the vertical coordinate, eight levels are used with boundaries at σ values of 0, 0.05, 0.14, 0.26, 0.42, 0.60, 0.77, 0.90 and 1.\n",
    "  The prognostic variables (except log(ps)) are specified at the σ levels in between the latter boundaries, namely at \n",
    "  σ 0.025, 0.095, 0.20, 0.34, 0.51, 0.685, 0.835 and 0.9\n",
    "- Time step: 40min. That is, 36 time steps per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional details, check the SPEEDY documentation [here](http://users.ictp.it/~kucharsk/speedy_description/km_ver41_appendixA.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The boundary conditions \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions needed to run SPEEDY are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time invariant fields (lon, lat):\n",
    "    - orog: Orographic height [m]\n",
    "    - lsm: Land sea mask fraction. Values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - vegl: Low vegetation cover (fraction). Values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - vegh: High vegetation cover (fraction). Values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - alb: Annual-mean albedo (fraction). Values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Monthly-average climatological fiel for each month of the year (lon, lat, month):\n",
    "    - stl: Land surface temp (top-layer) [degK].\n",
    "    - snowd: Snow depth [kg/m2]\n",
    "    - swl1: Soil wetness (layer 1) [vol. fraction, 0-1]\n",
    "    - swl2: Soil wetness (layer 2) [vol. fraction, 0-1]\n",
    "    - swl3: Soil wetness (layer 3) [vol. fraction, 0-1]\n",
    "    - icec: Sea-ice concentration (fraction). Values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - sst: Sea surface temperature [degK].\n",
    "- Anomaly fields (lon, lat, day):\n",
    "    - ssta: Sea surface temperature anomaly [degK].\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact shapes for the invariant fields are `(lon, lat, month) = (96, 48, 12)`. In contrast, the anomaly field (SST anomaly) needs to be provided for each day of the simulation period. For example, for a one-month forecast (30 days), the shape of the anomaly field is (96, 48, 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the pySPEEDY package includes the example boundary conditions initially included in the SPEEDY.f90 package. \n",
    "These fields were derived from the ERA-interim re-analysis using the 1979-2008 period. \n",
    "In addition, the default boundary conditions include the monthly SST anomalies for the 1979-01-01 to 2013-12-01 period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of pySPEEDY initializes all spectral variables at a reference atmosphere at rest with the following properties:\n",
    "Troposphere: T = 288°K at the surface. Constant temperature lapse rate.\n",
    "Stratosphere: T = 216 °K, lapse rate = 0.\n",
    "Pressure field consistent with the temperature field.\n",
    "Humidity: qv = RHref * q_saturation(288K, 1013hPa) with RHref=0.7.\n",
    "For this initialization, the following spectral variables are initialized:\n",
    "- \"vor [mx, nx, levels, 2]\": Vorticity in the spectral space. Complex.\n",
    "- \"div [mx, nx, levels, 2]\": Divergence in the spectral space. Complex.\n",
    "- \"t [mx, nx, levels, 2]\": Temperature in the spectral space. Complex.\n",
    "- \"ps [mx, nx, 2]\": Log of (normalised) surface pressure.\n",
    "- \"phi [mx, nx, levels]\": Atmospheric geopotential. Real.\n",
    "- \"phis [mx, nx]\": Surface geopotential. Real.\n",
    "- \"tr [mx, nx, levels, 2, ntr]\": Tracers. Currently, it only contains humidity. Real.\n",
    "\n",
    "where mx=31, nx=32, levels=8, ntr=1 (number of tracers).\n",
    "The \"2\" in the last dimension indicates that the variable is complex (0-real/1-imaginary)."
